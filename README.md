This is a genral outline of how I made this website:
Goal create a website that gathers data using APIs for information about skiing.
Not any free API's for skiing resorts
Started to learn about web scraping
Ran into web scraping security problems
Settled for manual inputting data for ski resorts
Found a free API for weather
What I learned about: API calls, Web scraping, HTML, Xpath, Azure SQL Databases, Blazor, various best practices
